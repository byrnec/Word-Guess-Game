##What the project does

Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
Display the following on the page:
Press any key to get started!
Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).



If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.

Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
    -this number will not go up if you guess the same letter twice!
Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).

After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
