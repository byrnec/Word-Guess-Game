# Halloween-themed Word Guessing Game


## What the project does

*Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.



*Press any key to get started!

*It will tell you how many times you have won and correctly guessed the word

*If the word is madonna, it displays like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.

*As the user guesses the correct letters, it reveals them: m a d o _  _ a.

*Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
*Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).

*After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.



## Why the project is useful
*I combine many different functions to create this app where we can guess a word. It was a helpful way to familiarize with combining for loops and functions.

## How users can get started with the project
* all you need is your browser!
